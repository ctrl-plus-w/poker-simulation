The course work has to meet the following criteria:

- employ polymorphism with at least two levels of inheritance and at least four separate classes;
- classes declared and defined in separate module or header files;
- at least one standard library container and at least two algorithms should be used;
- error management with at least one exception handling case must be used;
- the domain is up to you, but the software should perform a reasonably useful function; e.g., no classes A, B, C, and D
  printing one character messages.
