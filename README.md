## Start Script

```bash
python3 -m main.py
```

## Description

This project is a poker simulation and database seed generation tool. It allows users to simulate poker games and
generate seeds for databases, making it easier to test and develop poker-related applications.

When running the `main.py` file, you will be shown in the terminal the logs of the generated poker games.

## Requirements

The course work has to meet the following criteria:

- employ polymorphism with at least two levels of inheritance and at least four separate classes;
- classes declared and defined in separate module or header files;
- at least one standard library container and at least two algorithms should be used;
- error management with at least one exception handling case must be used;
- the domain is up to you, but the software should perform a reasonably useful function; e.g., no classes A, B, C, and D
  printing one character messages.
